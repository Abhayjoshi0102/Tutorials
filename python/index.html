<h2 id ="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Python is a general purpose<a href="#no1"><sup>1</sup></a> , interpreted, high level programming language. Some of the important features of Python are as below:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Multi-paradigm programming language (supports object oriented, functional, procedural paradigms)</li>
	<li>Emphasizes on code readability</li>
	<li>Dynamic typing<a href="#no2"><sup>2</sup></a> </li>
	<li>Automatic memory management</li>
</ul>

<h2 id ="uses">Why should I learn Python</h2>
<p>Python is used mainly in below mentioned fields:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Web development</li>
	<li>Data science</li>
	<li>Artificial intelligence</li>
	<li>Desktop and GUI application development</li>
</ul>

<h2 id ="fstprgm">Hello World</h2>
<p>Lets start Python with traditional hello world program. In order to write Python program, you mush have Python installed on your computer. If you are using Mac then Python would already be installed on your machine. To confirm, run <code class = "code"> python -v </code> command on your terminal. If Python is installed then it will return the version of Python installed on your machine. If you are using Windows machine, download Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a> and istall on your machine. If you do not want to install Python on your machine and practice online <a href="https://try.jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> is the best website.</p>

<p>Lets start writing our very first program. Type <code> python </code> on command line to start python shell. For printing anything to console use inbuilt function <code> print </code>. Type <code> print("Hello world")</code> and you are done. Here is the code written in Jupyter.</p>

<p id = "no1" class = "footer"><sup>1</sup> Pythin can be used for different pupposes like web development , machine learning, data visualization, not like PHP which is used just for web developmet. That's why it is called general purpose programming language.</p>
<p id = "no2" class = "footer"><sup>2</sup> In static type languages like C, Java, we need to define a variable of certain type and in its lifetime or scope it can not hold values of diferent type.</p>
